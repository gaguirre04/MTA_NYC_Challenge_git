This a Dash app that illustrates post-pandemic ridership recovery trends across the MTAâ€™s services and explores the impact of the **COVID-19** pandemic on public transportation usage in **New York City**, focusing on downtrends observed by the **MTA since 2020**. It highlights ridership patterns, the trend trajectory, and additional insights into the pandemic's broader context using COVID-19 confirmed and death cases data from **Johns Hopkins University (JHU CSSE)**. 
By combining transportation and health data, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how the pandemic reshaped urban mobility and public health.
